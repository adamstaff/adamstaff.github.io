				Hi! My name is Adam Staff.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am a freelance musician and producer, based in the South East of the UK.
			</p>
<!--		<p>
				As a producer-engineer, I have worked on multiple albums with Town of Cats and Luami, singles with Cloude Atlas, Sofia Edevane and Jake Hughes, and more.
			</p> -->
			<p>
				I'm here to make each song its best; whether that's by booking rooms, choosing microphones, tweaking synths or talking philosophy.
			</p>

			</p>
			<p>
				In recent years, most of my work has been producing people's music. <i>Production</i> has a broad meaning these days, and my work includes most of those meanings.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes that means project management, sometimes recording and mixing, sometimes arranging and performance. I'm here to fill in the gaps, or find the best person for the job.
			</p>
			<p>
				Along the way I have also done sound design and mixing for art installations, delivered workshops in sound programming and composition, and tutored in all things sound and technology.
			</p>

			<p>
				In my day-job, I work as a technician and demonstrator for the music department at the University of Sussex.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have also worked at loads of venues, festivals and studios, and in plenty of bedrooms, attics and kitchens.
			</p>
			<p>
				All this experience means that when it comes to your project, I can speak your language.
